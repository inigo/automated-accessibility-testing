automatedAccessibilityTesting is intended as an automated check for validity and accessibility
of web pages that can be run as part of a continuous integration system. It takes a list of URLs,
validates each using a local instance of the W3C validator, and checks their accessibility using
Schematron rules. It is written in XProc, XSLT and Schematron. The current implementation uses
Java, using Norm Walsh's "Calabash" XProc implementation, and Saxon for XSLT.
